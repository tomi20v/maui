Maui is a Minimal MongoDB mapper for PHP
Note this is a hobby project and is not and is not meant to be complete.

The basic idea is to provide a framework:
 - define objects by schema, including their attributes and relations
 - easily create and access data and relatives
 - basic CRUD (hard-coded MongoDB)
 - basic validation

Files, folders:
 app - sample app pieces
 bootstrap.php - just include this
 composer.json - just to include echop libs
 copying - see copyright notice
 ninja - some sketch, to be removed
 maui - maui lib
 README.md - reading this
 tests - some sporadic tests
 vendor/tomi20v/echop - pretty printer. Not necessary indeed
